This lab overall went well. I'm looking forward to learning more about JavaScript. I probably could have been a bit more creative with the JS, but I kept it simple and in line with the demo.

With CSS I'd like to know some "best practices." It seems like there are several ways to get to the same visual effect on the site. It also seems like you could do CSS forever. I'd also like to know more about formatting my html. Currently I have some h3 headings with lists and paragraphs underneath, but I know I should be using a section or article tag as well. Where I get stuck is where I want that section or article tag to start. I can see where wireframing is helpful in this instance.

I worked somewhat slowly, but this assignment took about 3.5 hours to complete. The CSS is not in the best shape, but I think it meets the requirements of the assignment. I'll continue to work on the CSS after submitting. I think this lab took about the amount of time I expected it to. The JavaScript work took longer than I anticipated, but it was great practice testing my script and finding errors.
